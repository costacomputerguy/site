  testimonial_item:
  - name: Susan Holdsworth
    designation: Internet Fix
    content: I struggled to setup our internet as the language was all in Spanish.
             CostaComputerGuy made it all work in no time at all. He advised what package to
             go for and set it up in our house so all our devices connect automatically.
  - name: Jonas Meyer
    designation: Purchase Laptop
    content: Our old laptop was on its way out. We needed to get a new one but did not know what to buy.
             CostaComputerGuy advised us of what we needed. The advice was priceless and we also used them 
             to setup the laptop for our daily use. We use CostaComputerGuy on an on-going basis to get us
             up to speed using our new laptop.
  - name: Alberto Morales
    designation: Hardware issues
    content: CostaComputerGuy fixed our computer and got us back working without a fuss. 
             Our computer had stopped working some time ago, and until we met CostaComputerGuy it
             was destined for the scrapheap. They replaced the hard-drive and hey presto, back to life it came.
             They also set up some online storage so we would not lose our files again.
  - name: Brian Wilson
    designation: VPN access
    content: Our online banking application had stopped working as we had moved to Spain but we still needed access
             to our accounts. CostaComputerGuy installed a VPN (whatever that is) and we could continue to use our
             banking app in Spain to manage our accounts. This worked on our phones and computer.
  - name: Lorenza Garcia
    designation: Basic Computer Lessons
    content: Since my family have moved overseas they have asked me to setup video calling so we can keep in touch.
             They contacted CostaComputerGuy to come to my house and set it all up. CostaComputerGuy spent time with me
             showing me how to call my family and give me confidence in using the software on my phone. My family are over the moon.
